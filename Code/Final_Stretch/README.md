This should be the final code developed for the dashboard, and hopefully the only python code needed to understand this project
Every other notebook only remains if:
- reference is needed for old methods or pathways of developing 
	- old maps
	- data conversion and pipeline for input
If none of the old maps/ideas I've done in the past is desired, then this notebook should be all you need
